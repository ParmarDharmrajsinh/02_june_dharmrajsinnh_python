I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally resign from my position as Software Developer at Tops Technologies, effective immediately, due to my health issues. Recently i get Covid Positive and I have to be quarantine.

I deeply regret the short notice and any inconvenience this may cause. This decision was not made lightly, and I sincerely apologize for the abruptness of my departure.

I am grateful for the opportunities I have had and for the support extended to me during my time with the organization. I appreciate your understanding and wish the team continued success.
